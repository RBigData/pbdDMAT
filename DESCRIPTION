Description: A set of classes for managing distributed matrices, and
    a collection of methods for computing linear algebra and
    statistics.  Computation is handled mostly by routines from the
    'pbdBASE' package, which itself relies on the 'ScaLAPACK' and
    'PBLAS' numerical libraries for distributed computing.
SystemRequirements: OpenMPI (>= 1.5.4) on Solaris, Linux, Mac, and
        FreeBSD. MS-MPI (Microsoft HPC Pack 2012) or MPICH2 (>=
        1.4.1p1) on Windows.
