Description: pbdDMAT contains high level S3 and S4 methods for creating,
        modifying, and performing computations with dense, distributed 
        matrices. This includes a new class, 'ddmatrix', for storing all 
        of the distributed data details.  Computation is handled mostly 
        by routines from the pbdBASE package.
SystemRequirements: OpenMPI (>= 1.5.4) on Solaris, Linux and Mac,
