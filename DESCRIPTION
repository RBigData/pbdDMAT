Description: pbdDMAT contains high level S3 and S4 methods for creating,
        modifying, and performing computations with dense, distributed 
		matrices. This includes a new class, 'ddmatrix', for storing all 
		of the distributed data details.  Computation is handled mostly 
		by routines from the pbdBASE package.
