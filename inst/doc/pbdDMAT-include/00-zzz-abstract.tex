With the size of data ever growing, the use of multiple processors in a single analysis becomes more and more a necessity.  The Programming Big Data (pbd) project attempts to address the \proglang{R} language's current shortcomings in parallel distributed computations. The \pkg{pbdDMAT} package for \proglang{R} provides high level S4 methods for the \pkg{pbdBASE} distributed matrix data type.  These methods focus on computationally burdensome problems with block-cyclically distributed data, such as linear algebra, in such a way that the syntax for operating on new data types mimics \proglang{R}'s syntax for ordinary matrices as closely as possible.  This allows someone already familiar with \proglang{R} syntax to achieve vast speed improvements via parallelism with a mostly already familiar syntax, and without the need to learn complicated parallel programming techniques.  Much of the heavy lifting is performed by the PBLAS and ScaLAPACK libraries.  In addition to performance improvements through parallelism, use of this system with more than one processor allows the user to break \proglang{R}'s local memory barrier, namely the requirement that a vector be indexed by a 32-bit integer, by only storing subsets of the vector on each processor.
