\usage{
\S4method{La.svd}{ANY}(x, nu = min(n, p), nv = min(n, p))

\S4method{La.svd}{ddmatrix}(x, nu = min(n, p), nv = min(n, p))

\S4method{svd}{ANY}(x, nu = min(n, p), nv = min(n, p),
  LINPACK = FALSE)

\S4method{svd}{ddmatrix}(x, nu = min(n, p), nv = min(n, p))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric distributed matrices.}

\item{nu}{number of left singular vectors to return when calculating
singular values.}

\item{nv}{number of right singular vectors to return when calculating
singular values.}

\item{LINPACK}{Ignored.}
}
\value{
\code{La.svd()} performs singular value decomposition, and returns the
transpose of right singular vectors if any are requested. Singular values
are stored as a global R vector. Left and right singular vectors are unique
up to sign. Sometimes core R (via LAPACK) and ScaLAPACK will disagree as to
what the left/right singular vectors are, but the disagreement is always
only up to sign.

\code{svd()} performs singular value decomposition. Differs from
\code{La.svd()} in that the right singular vectors, if requested, are
returned non-transposed. Singular values are stored as a global R vector.
Sometimes core R (via LAPACK) and ScaLAPACK will disagree as to what the
left/right singular vectors are, but the disagreement is always only up to
sign.
